<!-- Poem -->
<p>
Over my head, I see the bronze butterfly, <br> 
Asleep on the black trunk, <br> 
Blowing like a leaf in green shadow. <br> 
Down the ravine behind the empty house, <br>   
The cowbells follow one another <br> 
Into the distances of the afternoon. <br>  
To my right, <br> 
In a field of sunlight between two pines, <br>    
The droppings of last year&#39;s horses <br> 
Blaze up into golden stones. <br> 
I lean back, as the evening darkens and comes on. <br>   
A chicken hawk floats over, looking for home. <br> 
I have wasted my life. <br>
